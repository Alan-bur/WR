All textures included in this project were individually hand-drawn by me, Alan Burcet. I did not use any AI-generated content or automated upscaling tools in the creation of this project. Each texture has been redesigned from scratch, ensuring an original reinterpretation while maintaining the nostalgic essence of classic console interfaces.
