## About
This project aims to prevent Room Channel from pixelating on modern screens. It works for PC only and it can't be loaded by the real console since it does not support 4k Textures.

## Channel List
Each channel must be edited in order to make it 4K. If you have made one, then make a pull request so i add it to the project and the list<br>

## Known Bugs:

### Channels
<li>TV no Tomo Channel textures don’t fit very well making the lines and blocks not align correctly.</li>
<li>Mario Kart Channel thumbnail has blue stars and they should be displayed as yellow.</li>
<li>Riivolution needs a font change.</li>
<li>Wii System Transfer and Wii U Transfer Tool characters are not 4K.</li>

### Wii Menu
<li> Console Nickname: Setting a custom name for the Wii makes that section lose 4K quality. Setting the nickname into "Wii" or "wii" would make it work. </li>
<li> Calendar: I won’t turn the “Date” and “Time” sections into 4K because i have to make each texture for each year, minute and hour and that would take a lot of time. </li>
<li> Internet: “Manual setup” and “Change settings” for Wireless Conection are also imposible to make because each section has a custom input and that means infinite textures. </li>
<li> Parental Controls: I had to remake the “Choose a question” section so that the questions are not clickable. This was made so i don’t have to turn non sense textures into 4K. </li>
<li> The secret question section is also not 4K (and it won’t be) because it requires input. </li>
<li> Fonts are a bit missplaced </li>

## Next update
On the new update i will be modifying and polishing these:
<li>Mario Kart Channel</li>
<li>Mii Channel</li>
<li>Wii Sports Resort</li>
